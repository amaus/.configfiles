This is a git repository for all my configuration files for my
standard environment and tools:

.zshrc
.vimrc
.gitconfig
a.vim
zshprompt.zsh

To setup a new machine:
in the $HOME directory,

git clone amaus@aaronpmaus.com:~/git/configfile.git
cd configfiles
./setup.zsh

setup.zsh symlinks the dotfiles in configfiles to the home director.

To convert setup a machine that already has dot files on it,
will need to delete (or backup) those files:

But first, pull any settings from .zshrc that are specific
to that machine into a localSetings.zsh file in $HOME.
Then:

cd ~
rm .zshrc
rm .vimrc
rm .gitconfig
rm ./bin/a.vim
rm zshprompt.zsh

then clone and setup as above
